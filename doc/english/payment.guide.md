## id/key pairs

For some payment services, users must sign in first. The SDK has an *OAuth 2* client for our user system. You may apply for `client_id`/`client_secret` of *OAuth 2*ã€‚

For other 3rd-party payment services, users pay using their accounts in 3rd-party provider. But we need track the order in our system, which require *md5*/*RSA* to encrypt the request.

You may ask for two pairs of id/key.
- The `client_id` and`client_secret` of *OAuth 2*.
- The `partnerId` and *md5*/*RSA* key. If you want to use RSA, you need provide with your public key, and we'll provide you with our pubic key.

> Mobile number is required for signing up. If you couldn't finish the signing up, you may ask for a test user from user.

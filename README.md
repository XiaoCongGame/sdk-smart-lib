This is the Xiaocong SDK.

## Feature

* Xiaocong advertisement and pushing service.
* Xiaocong User/Account system service.
* Xiaocong Payment SDK.
* I18N support.

> Tip
* Our SDK is designed for TVs, which have higher resolution than mobile phones. We expect the resolution 1280px * 960px at least.
* Almost all android TVs in the market carry Android 4.0+. So we need `minSdkVersion > 14` .

## Quick Start

We provide you with an Eclipse Android Library Project. Add this project as your project's dependency project.

Also copy all libs in `libs` of the library project to your project's `libs`.

You may need ask for developer id/key before running some functions. Please refer to [doc](./doc).

This is the Xiaocong SDK.

## Feature

* Xiaocong advertisement and pushing service.
* Xiaocong User/Account system service.
* Xiaocong Payment SDK.

> Tip
* Our SDK is designed for TVs, which have higher resolution than mobile phones. We expect the resolution 1280px * 960px at least.
* Almost all android TVs in the market carry Android 4.0+. So we need `minSdkVersion > 14` .
* JDK 1.6+ required.
